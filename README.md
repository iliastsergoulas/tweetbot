# tweetbot
This is a Python program that is executed as a bot for Twitter, Tumblr and Reddit. The bot: 
- tweets posts for my two websites periodically. 
- follows users and likes posts in Twitter regarding specific keywords
- posts images in Twitter and Reddit
- everything posted goes also to my Tumblr accounts.
